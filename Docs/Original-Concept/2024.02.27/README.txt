Joke program: ChaccaronType / MaccaronType
When input is detected to be nonsensical keyboard spamming, audio clips can be triggered to play (the default example being Chaccaron Maccaron by El Chombo) similar to typing on FreeCodeCamp with the camp fire sounds settings turned on, it will continue to play audio as long as you are typing consecutively
Obviously can be turned on/off by the user whenever desired
